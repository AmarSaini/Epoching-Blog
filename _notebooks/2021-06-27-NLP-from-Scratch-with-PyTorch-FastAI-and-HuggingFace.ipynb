This tokenizer has lots of additional special tokens and special rules to help with better feature/token engeineering! (e.g. `xxbos` -> beginning of a text, and `xxmaj` -> next word capitalized) More can be found here in [chapter 10 from fastbook](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/10_nlp.ipynb)"

    "- We can take models written in pure PyTorch, or take existing models from elsewhere (e.g. HuggingFace), and train them with ease within fastai.\n",
    "- NLP has lots of variation in terms of tokenization methods. In my personal opinion*, libaries like fastai & HuggingFace make the NLP data processing pipeline much easier/faster to get up and running!\n",
    "- Each method has it's pros and cons:\n",
    "  - DistilBERT may have performed better, but this model has a much much larger number of parameters and possibly a much larger vocabulary!\n",
    "  - The runtime of DistilBERT was also much longer. ~16 minutes epochs (for a distilled transformer) vs ~2 min epochs (for a recurrent model)\n",
    "  - In other tasks, it may be better to use a transformer, but for many common NLP tasks, sometimes a simpler/smaller model is good enough!\n",
    "  - Even though transformers feed-forward it's input sequences in parallel (through positional encoding + self attention), they can be slower than simple recurrent networks due to their large model sizes."
